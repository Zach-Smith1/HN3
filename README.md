## Building and running on localhost

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Running

Open the file `dist/index.html` in your browser

## Note

This build is limited to a redesigned front page of Hacker News, there are no login, post, comment, etc. capabilities.
Links to articles can be followed, all other Hacker News links are for show and will redirect to an "under construction" page.

Thanks!
